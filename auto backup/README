## Python Auto Backup Script

A simple **cross-platform backup script** written in Python.  
It creates **timestamped backups** of a given folder and stores them in a destination folder as either **.zip** or **.tar.gz** archives.  
Old backups are automatically deleted if they exceed a set limit.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔹 Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- 🔹 Choose between `.zip` (Windows-friendly) or `.tar.gz` (Linux/macOS).
- 🔹 Automatically cleans up old backups (keeps only the latest ones).
- 🔹 Easy-to-edit config at the top of the script.
- 🔹 Simple, lightweight, no external dependencies.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python **3.6+**
- No external libraries needed (only built-in Python modules).

Edit these variables at the top of `auto_backup.py`:

```python
SOURCE_DIR = r"C:\path\to\source"    # Folder you want to back up
BACKUP_DIR = r"C:\path\to\backup"    # Destination folder for backups
MAX_BACKUPS = 5                      # Max backups to keep
BACKUP_FORMAT = "zip"                # "zip" or "tar.gz"
