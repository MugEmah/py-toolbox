# 🔍 Multithreaded Network Scanner

A fast and lightweight Python-based network scanner that uses **multithreading** to quickly check if hosts are alive.  
It supports single IPs, domain names, and entire networks in **CIDR notation**.  
Includes a **progress bar**, **colored output**, and **graceful exit** on `Ctrl+C`.  

---

## ✨ Features
- 🚀 **Multithreaded scanning** for speed (default: 50 threads).
- 🎨 **Color-coded output**: 
  - 🟢 Green for UP hosts
  - 🔴 Red for DOWN hosts
- 📦 **CIDR support**: Scan entire subnets at once.
- 🔧 **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- 🛑 **Graceful exit** when interrupted (no ugly tracebacks).
